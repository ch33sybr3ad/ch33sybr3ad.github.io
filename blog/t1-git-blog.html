    <h3> What is version control? </h3>
    	<p>
    		A version control system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Every change made is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and includes refereces to the problems the change fixed or enhanced. Version control is essential to developers because it allows them to revert files or even the entire project back to a previous state. Think of this as a save point in a video game. If you made any huge mistakes or accidentally deleted your entire project, you can simply recall the last saved version of your work with version control.

    <h3> Git vs. GitHub </h3>
    	<p>
        	Git and GitHub are two very prominent forms of version control for programmers. Although they serve very similar purposes, Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a version control software that is downloaded and lives locally on your computer. GitHub is also a form of version control, but lives remotely on the internet. Think of Git as a word processor and think of GitHub as Google Docs. Word processors only allows the user to access and edit your work locally, while  Google Docs allows a team of individuals to simultaneously edit and improve a single project.
