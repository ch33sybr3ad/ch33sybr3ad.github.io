  <h1>DBC Week 1 - Cultural Blog</h1>
  <h2>Fireside Chat Reflections</h2>
  <h4>February 6, 2015</h4>

  	<h3> What's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? </h3>
  		<p>
  		I think of DBC as this magical place that has the ability to gather amazing peole to complete the seemingly impossible task of learning programming in a mere nine weeks from scratch. I mean it's only been a couple days and I'm already creating/writing my own blog page. It's amazing that DBC was able to create the "DBC experience." All of DBC's instructors as very intelligent people (both EQ and IQ), whom truly want to see the success of their students. From the Fireside Chat, you can see that DBC has come a long way - through the dedication of devotion of both instructors and students - to become what it is today. I hope that my cohort can supply as much energy and intiative that the very first cohort had.

  	<h3> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
  		<p>
  		I'm extremely excited to be engaging with this type of work culture. Many of DBC's core values resonate with those of my own. I believe that failure is integral with success and that it is better to fail at something than to never try. Shereef's analogy of th Kitchen vs. Table mindset makes a lot of sense to me. DBC is a place that provides the environment and resources for me to grow as an individual, but I won't be able to succeed unless I have the initiative and drive necessary.

  	<h3> Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?</h3>
  		<p>
  		My expectations of DBC have not changed. I have always viewed DBC as a place for both personal growth and technical learning. 
  		</p>
  	<h3> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3>
  		<p>
  		I'm extremely excited to participate in DBC's learning environment. Although DBC's curriculum is extremely intense and challenging, this is the exact environment that I was looking for. I am a little nervous because I don't have any previous experience with programming at all. But, I'm way more excited to be a part of this program and really can't wait to learn more!
