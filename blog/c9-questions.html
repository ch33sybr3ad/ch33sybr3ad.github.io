      <p> Researching is essential when you are learning anything new, programming included and asking good questions play a key part in your research. I think we had a really great Google+ community for our DBC bootcamp. There were not bad questions nor did people ignore or fail to answer them. Instead I will write about several tips to writing a good question!. <br><br>

      1. <strong>Do your research: </strong>Do not just post a question about a topic without doing research first. A lot of the times, you can answer the question on your own if you took the time to find the answer. It can be uncessary and a waste of time to ask simply questions that can be easily search.</br><br>

      2. <strong>Include all of the necessary details: </strong>You want to help your potential respondent with as much information as possible to have them answer your questions. Try summing up your entire question in one sentence, so that people can have an idea of the topic you are asking about. </br><br>

      3. <strong>Use proper syntax: </strong>After you have done your research and still can't find the answer, make sure to post your answer with proper spelling, grammar and punctuation. Also format your question properly so that your code is readable.</br><br>

      4. <strong>Proofread: </strong>Always proofread before posting! It can be embarrasing if the question you are asking doesn't describe the problem accurately or doesn't make sense. After you proofread you are ready to post your question! </br> <br>

      It's really important for anyone to ask questions in order to futher your learning! This is the last blog post for the off-site section of DBC. I'll be heading to SF next week to start learning programming on site.
