      <p> Gregorc's Mind Styles model organizes how the mind works into four seperate categories.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Concrete Sequential - ordered, sequential linear thinking</li>
        <li>Abstract Sequential - experimental thinking </li>
        <li>Concrete Random - relective, unstructured thinking</li>
        <li>Abstract Random - worldly and abstract thinking</li>
      </ul>
      <p> My results for the Gegorc Thinking Style quiz reveals that I am a very strong Concrete Sequential thinker. Scoring a 52/60 in that category. I scored a 32/60 for AS, 12/60 for CR, and 24/60 for AR. I feel that these results make a lot of sense. I myself am a very rational logical oriented individual. I like to dissect large problems into small ones and solve them one piece at a time. I'm really good at simplifying complex problems/situations and coming up with the most efficient solution. </p>
      <p> I think that this thinking style is great for learning programming at DBC. I thrive in structured environments with concrete goals and I love problem solving. I had a lot of fun solving the week 3 ruby exercises. I think my biggest struggle of this week is time management. I can easily get caught up in an exercise or working on my website and spend too much time. I need to practice time boxing in order to use my energy more efficicently. I found out that you can burn out from working on programming too much in a day and that you only really have a few key hours of solid work. I need to learn to channel those hours more efficiently. </p>
      <p> One of the reasons why I love DBC so much is that the curriculum is so much more than just programming. I think mindset is an extremely important factor when trying to overcome challenges. If you do not believe you can succeed, what is the point of trying? Although I didn't know the technical term for it, I have always held a growth mindset and believed that I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. </p>
