We spent [2] hours on this challenge.

Reflections: Pairing this time was a lot of fun like last time. However, I feel that my partner this time was not as prepared as my partner in GPS 1.1. However, I really enjoyed working and felt extremely comfortable with with both of my cohort members. I feel like I had a good grasp of the learning competences and did not have to look up anything during the pairing challenge. This challenge gave me a really good understanding of pair-programming and how it's a lot more efficient do write code once correctly with two people, than multiple times incorrectly with one person.

      <p> <strong> Pair Programming </strong> </p>
      <p> Pair programming is when two individuals work together on one project. One is the driver and the other is the navigator.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <p> Pair programming allows for better accountability while writing the code. Instead of one guy writing the code by himself, he has a partner who can observe and catch his mistakes! It's a lot faster to write code perfectly the first time vs. wasting time to backtrack and fix careless mistakes. </p>

    <div class="section driver"> 
      <p> <strong> Driver </strong> </p>
      <p> The Driver is the individual who is actually writing code into the program. The Driver will write the code first - somewhat a rought draft. </p>
    </div>
 
    <div class="section">
    <p> <strong> Navigator</strong> </p>
    <p> The Navigator looks over the code that the Driver is typing and makes sure there are no mistakes, both small and overarching ones. The Navigator should not be the back seat driver and should be thinking on the macro level.  </p>
