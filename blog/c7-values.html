      <p> <strong> Exploring Your Values </strong> </br>
      When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?: </br> </br>
      Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
      <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment: 5 </li>
        <li>Confidence: 5</li>
        <li>Leadership: 5</li>
        <li>Meaningful Work: 5</li>
        <li>Growth: 5</li>
        <li>Effectiveness: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p> The reason I gave myself all 5's on these values is because these are the values that I strive to achieve every day. However out of these values, I think the most important value to me is growth. This is because no matter what, as long as you have personal growth and continually make effort to improve yourself, you will be a better person in the long run. For example, if you are the most confident or effective person in the world, it doesn't mean that you will stay that way. If you strive to be the most confident or the most accomplished, growth can help you achieve that.</p> 
      <p> I'm a college senior and most of my friends are finishing or about to finish their undergrad eduation. The last topic someone asked me for advice on was about what to do in life. I think this touched upon the value of "Meaningful Work". I think this is really important, because even if you are a smart and motivated individual. Your ambitions will fade if you're doing something that you don't want to do. Having a meaningful job and feeling that you are doing something meaningful is extremely important to success. </p>
