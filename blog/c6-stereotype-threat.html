    Stereotype Threat refers to being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. Studies have shown that performance can be harmed by increasing or decreasing awareness of one's identity. <i>Steele and Anderson</i> (1995) showed in several experiments that Black students did more poorly on standarized tests than White students when their race was emphazises, but performed better or equal to than White students when their race was not emphasized.

    Social Identity - sense of who we are that comes from group memberships and social categories to which we belong: age, sex, race, religion, progession, ethnicity, nationality, etc... 

    Identity Contingencies are things you have to deal with because of your identity. 

    Identity threat is instrinsit to most diverse settings, the default state of affairs unless something is done to reduce it.

    <p> I think this type of research is extremely fascinating. I found it a little hard to believe that one's identity could have such a large impact on one's academic/personal performance. I do not think I have ever been negatively affected by stereotype threat. Being an Asian male, I feel like there's more pressure to overperform academically than to underperform. I would imagine that feeling stereotype threat would be an immensely frustrating and unfair experience. I think it's ridiculous to judge an individual solely based on superficial qualities.
