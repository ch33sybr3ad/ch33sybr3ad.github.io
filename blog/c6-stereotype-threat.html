    <p> <Strong> What is Stereotype Threat? </Strong> </br>
    Stereotype Threat refers to being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. Studies have shown that performance can be harmed by increasing or decreasing awareness of one's identity. For example, the study <i>Steele and Anderson</i> (1995) showed that in several experiments that Black students did more poorly on standarized tests than White students when their race was emphazises, but performed better or equal to than White students when their race was not emphasized.</p>

    <p> I think this type of research is extremely fascinating. At first, I found it a little hard to believe that one's identity could have such a large impact on one's academic/personal performance. It was really interesting to me about how Claude M. Steele analyzed an individuals identity and how it affect his or her behavior; he used a term called Identity Contingencies, which are things you have to deal with simply because of your identity. How strongly an individual correlates with his or her identity affects how strongly an individual will try to protect or preserve their identity. </p>

    <p> I do not personally feel that I have been affected by Stereotype Threat. I never really have felt that my race or identity was a limiting factor. I have spent most of my life in school, and I, being an Asian male, feel like there was more competition pushing me to overperform instead of underperform academically. I feel like I'm the type of person that if I was told in a test scenario that males perform worst on this test, I would be more motivated to prove that statement wrong.</p>

    <p> However, I can see how this effect is detrimental. With stereotype effect a lot of prejudices minorities are performing a lot worse than their true capabilities. This is extremely unfair because it doesnt allow the most capable individual to succeed, which is inherently unfair. The smartest person should receive the highest score, irregardless of race, identity or relgion. I feel like the only way to prevent stereotype threat is to keep an open mind and to make sure to welcome people of different identities and to stay away from stereotyping people before you have the change to meet them. </p>
