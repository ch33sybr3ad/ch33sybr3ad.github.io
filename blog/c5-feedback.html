      <p><strong>Pairing</strong></p>
      <p> I can't believe it's already 5th week at DBC! These past few weeks has given me the opportunity to pair with a lot of my amazing cohortmates to work on solving coding challenges together. I really enjoy the concept of pairing; not only does it useful when we get real developing jobs, but it also a great way to introduce and meet each other. My favorite part about pairing is getting to know my cohortmates and learning new shortcuts and methods from them. On the reverse side, it's extremely rewarding when I get the opportunity to teach someone something new about programming. </p>
      <p> The times I feel pairing is frustrating or difficult is when your pairing partner didn't take the time to review the material and doesn't know how to use simple methods that we should already know by now.  If one partner knows a lot more advanced coding, it's hard for the other partner to keep up (I have been on both sides in previous pairing sessions). I think the best pairing sessions occur when both partners are at an equal knowledge level of coding.</p>
      <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
      <p>I really like the concept of the Feedback system that DBC implements for phase 0. I think it's great that we get to read about how others perceive our progress and to rate other cohortmates on how they are doing. Unfortunately, I feel like the system is not working as well as is should. All of the feedback I have received have been extremely positive, though I feel this could be because the feedback is not as "anonymous" as you would expect. It's not that hard to derive who left you which feedback, which makes it harder for people to leave really constructive feedback. There are a couple exceptions, but generally speaking, most of the feedback that I have reviewed/received are very positive and lack constructive criticisms.</p>
