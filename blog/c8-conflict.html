      <p> <strong> Sources of Conflict </strong> </br>
        The last time I had a conflict was similar to the situation of the woman in the example used by DBC. In college, I lived in a house with 7 other guys, so cleanliness was a huge issue. A lot of the times dishes weren't done and they would pile up. The messy appearance of the kitchen encouraged other messy behaviors, which slowly caused the house to become worse and worse. The source of the conflict was that people were too busy to do dishes sometimes or would simply forget to do them after eating. When they piled up after a while, people would forget who used what and just not do the dishes. It was because it was easier to not to the dishes, compared to doing everyone else's for them. This got so bad that we started using paper cups/plates. </br>
        This issue was really frustrating for me because if everyone did their part properly, this dishes shouldn't even be an issue. It was also frustrating because we all shared cooking utensils and pots/pans. So if someone else used up all of the cookware and it was in the sink dirty, you had to wash it before you could use it. </br>
        The solution was actually pretty simple. We all realized that dishes was an issue and sat down to figure out a solution. We ended up deciding that each person will be assigned a "dish day" and have to do all of the dishes by that night. Since there were 7 of us, this ended out working perfectly. There were times when people forgot to do their dish day, so we assigned punishments for forgetting your day, the punishment was to do the next two days if you forgot. <br>
        The only thing I could change would be to sit down and talk about the solution faster, before letting it escalate to the level that it had in our house. I learned that communication is probably the most effective way to solve personal issues and that you should always be seeking ways to communicate your issues and seek to resolve them. If you instead ignore your emotions and let it build up, it will lead to larger problems than the original one.
