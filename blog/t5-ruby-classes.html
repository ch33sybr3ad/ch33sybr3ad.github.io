    <h2>Tech World's Gender Problem</h2>
    <h4><em>February 28, 2015</em></h4>

      <p> After doing a lot of research about the biggest problems in the tech world. I feel overwhelmingly that the problem with tech culture lies in the huge disparity between the number of men and women programmers. According to the New York Times, only 25% of computer science related jobs were held by women; even in fields such as science, engineering and technology, quit rates for women are 47%, 39% and 56%, respectively.</p>
      <p> It wasn't always this way. Six women programmed one of the most famous computers in history - the 30-ton Eniac - for the United States Army during World War II. But, when programming began to gain prestige, women were slowly pushed out of the industry. In 2012, only 19% of computer-science graduates were women, comparted to 37% in 1985. </p>
      <p> I think the first step towards solving this problem is to openly talk about it. A lot of "women in tech" are afraid to open dialoges about gender issues out of fear of being shunned. A lot of prominent tech leaders have already recognized this issues and are taking efforts to solve them. We should follow their lead and make efforts to close the gender gap. </p>
