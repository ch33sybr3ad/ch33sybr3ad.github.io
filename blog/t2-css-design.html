      <p> <strong>The Purpose of Classes and ID's </strong></p>
      <p>
        In programming, we have the basic elements such as "h1", "p", or "ul". While these will often do the job, there are some instances where you would want one h1 tag to do something different from another h1 tag. This is were classes and id's come in! Classes and id's allow you to target snipets of code specifically, so that it may be manipulated without affecting other similar elements. For example, you can do "div id="header"" in order to target all of the code that make up your heading. 
      </p>
      <p> <strong>Classes vs. ID's </strong></p>
      <p>
        The main difference between these two selectors lies in their uniqueness. Classes are non-unique; this means that you can use the same class in multiple elements and multiple classes on the same element. ID's, on the other hand, are unique; this means that each element can only have one ID and each page can only have one element with that ID. Being able to apply more than one class to the same line of code can be very helpful in complex programs. For example, if you use the class id "widget" several times in your code, but you want to make one of the widget lines different. You could simply name the class "widget unique" and that line would have attributes of both the widget class and the unique class. However, ID's have a special browser functionality to them. ID's have a "hashtag value" in the url. If you have the #IDname in your url address, the browser will attempt to locate the element with an ID of "comments" and will automatically scroll to the page showing that element. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that an element can have both and class and an ID tag! Which means that if necessary, you can incorporate both benefits of a class or tag. It is also important to remember that CSS doesn't differentiate between ID and class tags, so you can use either when you want to style you web page.
