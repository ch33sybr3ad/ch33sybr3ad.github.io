    <p> The history of the internet begins in the 1950s with the development of the electronic computer. The US Department of Defense awarded contracts as early as 1960s for the development of ARPANET, the first network to use the Internet Protocol. The first message sent over ARPANET was from the computer science laboratory at UCLA to the econd network node at Stanford. However, the internet that we see today is most similar to the World Wide Web invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. The web created a common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks, thus allowing the public to access huge amounts of information on a faily basis. </br></br>
    So how does the internet work? The internet is a global collection of networks of varying sizes. These networks connect together in many different ways to form the single entity we know as the Internet. There are many ways to connect to the internet. Most of us use a modem to connect to an ISP (Internet Service Provider), which are connected to each other through NAPs (Network Access Points). You can also form LAN (Local Area Networks), which are just a group of computers that are connected together locally. This can be used for playing games together locally or by business who work on the same network. </br></br>
    All of these networks rely on NAPs, backbones and routers to talk to each other. Routers determine where to send information from one computer to another, each machine on the internet has an unique IP address which can be the destination for information to be sent. Backbones are typically fiber optic trunk lines and are strategically interconnected computer networks and core routers on the Internet. </br></br>
    When the internet was a smaller collection of computers, there were relatively few links and you could access them with their IP address directly. However, this soon became inconvenient as more and more users joined the World Wide Web. We developed DNS (Domain Name System) to map text names to IP addresses automatically. This way you can type www.google.com instead of typing Google's IP address. </br></br>
    The Internet is made possible through the support or servers. Servers are essentially machines that provide services to other machines. All of the machines on the internet are either servers or clients. When you go to google.com you are using a client machine (your computer) and accessing Google's servers. Google's server machines will find the page you want and send it to you allowing you to access it. </p>
